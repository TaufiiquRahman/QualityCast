QualityCast
  QualityCast is one of the AI tools designed to detect defects in casting production output. This project aims to automate the quality inspection process that has been done manually, which is time-consuming and not always accurate. By implementing a deep learning classification model, QualityCast can detect different types of defects in casting products more quickly and accurately.
